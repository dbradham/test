Global City Data: has 45 different indicators for about 75 of the largest cities. Indicators include GDP per capita, poverty, transportation, and others.
(This data is currently in a .xls but we plan to convert it to a .csv) We looked for a more robust dataset but chose this one because of the large number of indicators.

Education Statistics: Query holds over 4,000 internationally comparable indicators that describe education access, progression, completion, literacy, teachers, population, and expenditures.

We decided to use a health dataset and a dataset that had indicators of economic status to see if there were connections, and how profound they are, between health and income at a macro level.
We also thought it would be interesting to see if education had a dramatic effect on nutrition and/or income.
